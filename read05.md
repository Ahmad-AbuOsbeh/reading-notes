### JavaScript & jQuery

#### Comparison and logical operators :

== : is equal to, it's used to compere two values regardless their datatypes then if it the smae it will return a boolean = true.
!= : is not equal to, it's used to compere two values regardless their datatypes then if it the smae it will return a boolean = false.
=== : strict equal to, it's used to compere two values and compare their datatypes then if it all the smae it will return a boolean = true.
!== : strict not equal to, it's used to compere two values and compare their datatypes then if it all the smae it will return a boolean = false.
> : greater than, it's used to compere two numbers, then it will return a boolean = true or false
< : smaller than, it's used to compere two numbers, then it will return a boolean = true or false
>= : greater than or equal to, it's used to compere two numbers, then it will return a boolean = true or false
<= : smaller than or equal to, it's used to compere two numbers, then it will return a boolean = true or false

logical operators : it allows you to compare more than one comparison operator.

&& : and and ( logical and ), it must have two trues one on each side, then will get true;another else always will get false
|| : or or ( logical or ),it must have two false one on each side, then will get false ;another else always will get true
!  : logical not, it return the revers always >> !true = false 

### Loops :

loops are a certain components together do the checking process of their condition then if the condition is true, then it will do the loop again, but if not, it will break the loop.

types of loops :

- for loop : to do the loop for a certain number that user can determine it.
- while loop : we use the while loop when we don't know the number of times that we should do the loop, in the while loop; if the condition is true will do the loop again, but if the condition result was false it will break out of the loop.

- Do While : the same of the while loop, but the different is in Do while loop it will do the loop even if the condition is false at least one time.

it is important for the loops to contain three main things : 
1-initializing values  
2-condition 
3- ubdating values

**for loop : for(initial value; condition;updating;) { do this function when command is true,then break the loop when it false}

**while loop : define the variable before the loop as an initial value then 
while ( condition ) {do this function when command is true,then break the loop when it false + updating the value}
