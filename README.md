## Growth mindset:
### I think the growth mindset is about the amount of the efforts and number of falls that makes the person never stop trying to reach his goals, and I think as person got or faced a huge number of falls in his life, then if he didn't give up, will become more stronger and a self independent person.

**things that motivate me always :**
> No efforts will gone without benefit, but we don't know when will need what we try today and how! ( the sucsee is existing in the failure, but we should reach or find it )

> try and try and try. ( don't give up) 👍

> fill your time with a good things, NO excess time here 🕙
