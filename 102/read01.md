most important factors to select the text editors :
- code completion ( as an example: close the opening tags )
- multi themes ( change the background color)
- the ability to add extensions ( some features added to save time)
- syntax highlighting ( give each thing in the code a different color)

the command line is a place to make multi orders in your system as you do with GUI, you will write some commands then will get a result of each command on the same window.

some of the commands :

- pwd : to get the path of the folder
- ls : to get all directories and files ( except hidden files that start with dot . )
- ls - la : to get all directories and files including the hidden files.
- cd : to open the contents of the directory.
- cd ../.. : back twice

some of the extensions and meanings :

- name.exe: it's a program or setup file
- name.txt: it's a text file.
- name.png/gif/jpg : it's an image.
