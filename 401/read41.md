# Review, Research, and Discussion

**>> Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”**

- Redux toolkit has built in functions to help you buid your redux states.
- but Redux Ducks is easy to use and to deal by the user.

**>> What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit**

- built in methods to create the store, reducers, actions, and so on.

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### >>> redux toolkit slices : function in tool kit that allows you to build the reducer with its actions.

### >>> namespace : Namespace refers to the programming paradigm of providing scope to the identifiers (names of types, functions, variables, etc) to prevent collisions between them.

# Preparation Materials

<br/>

# getting started with react native

- basic example with React native :

```
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const YourApp = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
      <Text>
        Try editing me! 🎉
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default YourApp;
```

# react native basics (Tutorial)

- React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks.

- with react native still needs react to write JSX.

- react native supports ES6

- props in react native : it is a parameters that custumize the components when they are created.

- View component: it is a container for other components, to help control style and layout.

- no any difference between react and react native with dealing with states.

<br/>

# react native

- with react native you can Create native apps for Android and iOS using React.

- fast refresh in react native, you can see your changes as soon as you save

  <br/>

# expo

- expo : develop for all your users' devices with just one codebase. Add fast refresh, true native capabilities, and your creativity, and you'll have the app your users want in no time.

- with expo you can deploy a fix that your users will see instantly, without having to re-download your app.

  <br/>

# ejecting

- ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project

- Expo apps are written in pure JS and never "drop down" to the native iOS or Android layer. This is core to the Expo philosophy and it's part of what makes Expo fast and powerful to use.

### when I need the ExpoKit ?

- The most common situation is when a project requires a specific Native Module which is not supported by React Native Core or the Expo SDK.
