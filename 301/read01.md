# Introduction to React and Components



## Component Based Architecture

</br>

**1. What is a component?**
- as what I undersood, the component is a thing that does a certain functionality, it can connect with other components and do a new behaviour. it has been written by some poeple by writing codes that represent the final result that we can see them as components.

**2. What are the charactistics of a component?**

- Reusability : we can use them in different applicatios, but there is some components designed for a specific task.
- Replaceable : you can replace the component with the similar one.
- Not context specific : there is no specific environment that component should work on it. (flexibility)
- Extensible : you can extend new component from another one to build a new functionality.
- Encapsulated : you can use the functionality of the component without knowing its internal process cycle.
- Independent : each component desogned to have a minmal limit of dependencies of other components

**3. What are the advantages of using component based architecture?**

- Ease of deployment (no conflicts when update the version to new one)
- Reduced cost (when you use a third party component it will reduce the cost of development and maintenance)
- Ease of development (when you use a component with good code it will not affect other components in your system)
- Reusable (you can use the same component in another systems and applications)
- Modification of technical complexity
- Reliability (when each component is reliable, then the reliability of the whole system will improve)
- System maintenance and evolution (you can edit and change the component easly without affecting the rest components in your system)
- Independent (each component desogned to have a minmal limit of dependencies of other components)

## What is Props and How to Use it in React
</br>


**1. What is props short for?**
- props stands for **properties**

**2. How are props used in React?**
- by define an attribute (props) in the parent component, then we call this attribute into child component by dot notation, props.propName. in another way; we can send data from component to another.

**3. What is the flow of props?**
- uni-directional flow, one way flow : from parent to chaild.




## Things I want to know more about
- I have to understand the meaning of Component Based Architecture again.
